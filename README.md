- 👋 Hi, I’m @chonochonovuk
- 👀 My experience  in  programming  started  with  developing  static  HTML  pages  which  was  followed  by  two  years  of  Java certification  program  and  excellent  understanding  of  Java  OOP,  Java  Web,  Java  DB,  Spring  Web,  Spring  Data  and  S.O.L.I.D. Principles  which  I  combined with my good knowledge of CSS, AJAX, HTML and Javascript  in  building  Spring  Boot  REST API as a defence  project.
- 🌱 Learning new  technologies  has  not stopped  with  Java, furthermore,  I  invested  time  in  developing an SPA  with  Angular and building  Android  Applications  with  Kotlin.
- 💞️ A good compliment to all these skills is recently completed DevOps course which make me capable of managing the whole SDLC by adding value and improving flow to any on-premise or cloud solutions.
